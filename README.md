# Code-Refactoring

In this project I refactored code for an existing page, improving accessibility and functionality.
I changed a lot of the HTML elements to semantic tags, and the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. The header attributes now fall in sequential order, and I added alt attributes to images for standard accessibility purposes. I also fixed links in the page and solved styling issues within those changes.
